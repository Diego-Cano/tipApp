Tip Calculator App
Welcome to the Tip Calculator App! This Android application is designed to make it easy to calculate tips and split bills among multiple people. With a user-friendly interface and additional features like rounding up tips and selecting different tip percentages, this app ensures you always leave the right amount. 
This app was developed as part of my learning journey in Android development using Jetpack Compose. It includes features such as entering the bill amount, selecting the tip percentage through radio buttons, rounding up the tip, and splitting the bill among multiple people. The app also provides a detailed breakdown of the total amount and the amount each person needs to pay. I hope you find this app useful and enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
